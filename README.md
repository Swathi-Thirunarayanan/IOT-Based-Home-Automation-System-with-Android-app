# IOT-Based-Home-Automation-System-with-Android-app
Implement an app named “49er Sense” on your Android mobile device, that closely models the CPI inTouch app:
```

```
In addition to the sensors and actuators shown in the CPI app, 49er Sense should be built for homes with the following additional features:

 * The home is also a renewable power generator.
 *	Electric power consuming appliances should be part of the home and its IoT.
 *	The App should be accessible to a Utility company which can control the appliances to optimize their schedules (subject to customer     constraints) and reduce cost of operation to the consumer (assume that power cost varies with time). 

There are 3 types of users for this App: Consumers (who could be simultaneously power producers), Power generators and Utility company
The app should interact with your backend LAMPP server (running on your laptop) – the backend server has the user DB implemented on MySQL. 

The IoT in the user home consists of the Laptop (backend server), 2 Raspberry Pi boards (corresponding to 2 floors in the home – each RPi board implements all sensor and actuator devices on a single floor, except the camera), a mobile phone/tablet with a Camera (as a security webcam), and a Router.

### The app also displays:
1.	The home total energy consumption and the breakdown by categories
2.	The weather report for today and next 5 days
3.	Video feed on request
4.	Account settings
5.	Notifications for user (using an Inbox).

Re (1): Each device is requested by the server for its energy consumption; the numbers are added by category; the results are reported to the app.

Re (2): Weather report is pulled by the server at the user’s home location from the cloud, and sent to the app.

Re (3): The video feed from the webcam is channeled through the router to the server to the app.

Re (4) & (5): Direct communication between server and app.

### Deliverables:
*	App on your mobile device
* Htdocs php codes on your server
*	Java codes for sensors/actuators running on the RPi boards
*	All databases
*	Server-Client Socket Communication codes for the laptop and the RPi boards (with NMap integration)
*	Webcam integration with RPi boards, feeding app through server, with record on server facility
*	Breadboard integration with RPi boards (for sensor/actuator controllability/observability) OR java scripts to simulate memory-mapped I/Os
